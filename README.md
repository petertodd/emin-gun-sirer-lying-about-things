# Emin GÃ¼n Sirer Lying About Things

Work in progress; pull-req's welcome! Best to keep this to the strictest
possible definition, e.g. clear lies (including lying by omission), not simply
ill-advised opinions.  So him claiming Bitcoin will crash due to selfish mining
is an opinion. Don't forget to archive any relevant websites with the [Internet
Archive Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) and [archive.is](https://archive.is).

Hopefully this will result in retractions and/or rebuttals and this repo will
stay empty, but we'll see...
